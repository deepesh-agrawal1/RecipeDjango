Iâ€™m thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed a 5-day workshop on Mastering Industry-Grade Python Skills, where I deepened my knowledge of API development using the Django Ninja framework and other advanced Python concepts.

As part of the workshop, my team and I developed a Recipe Management API, implementing CRUD operations for recipes with fields like name, ingredients, and cooking steps. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my technical expertise but also reinforced the value of teamwork and collaboration in software development.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways:
 âœ… API Development using Django Ninja
 âœ… Practical application of industry-grade Python skills
 âœ… Team collaboration & problem-solving in real-world projects
Iâ€™m proud to have received a Certificate of Completion, marking another milestone in my journey of continuous learning. ðŸ“œ

A big thank you to the mentors [Mr. Krishnakant mane sir(kk)and prajakta mam] and organizers for making this an enriching experience! Looking forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuing to grow in this dynamic field. ðŸš€
